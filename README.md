**About**

For my final project I want to capture the state of my mind at my most productive time of the day. Im going for a kind of hackathon and hallucinatory aesthetic. It seems like a strange combination, but let me explain. During my different experiences handling large projects I find that I am usually consuming energy drinks and spending vast hours hacking away at a program from night to the peeks of sunrise. I find that after absurd hours in the night your mind begins to feel disoriented and your vision might also go a little more hazy as your eyes begin to waver for some precious sleep. I want this project to represent my mindstate during this time. A creative craze, that can widthstand being tired for the sake of prolonged productivity. A kind of tired state of artifical energy where creativity takes over and your mind wanders to unexplored realms. I want to achieve this effect by having a terminal route to all the drawings (representing the work usually done at this time) and each drawing having features that appaer unusual, psychoactive,  maybe even almost hallucinatory (representing the state of a restless mind solving away at troublesome problems).
